*Entityâ€“relationship model*
![ERD!](images/ERD.png)


## Main Mongoose Model **Comment Model**

```js 
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const commentSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    username: { type: String, require: true },
    text: { type: String, require: true },
    gameId: { type: String, require: true }
  }
)

const Comment = mongoose.model('Comment', commentSchema)

module.exports = Comment
```

## Favorite JSX **Show.jsx** 
```js
<ul className='commentContainer'>
                    {
                        this.props.game.comments.map((comment) => {
                            const { username, text, gameId } = comment
                            console.log(comments)
                            return (
                                <li key={comment._id} className='commentBox'>
                                    {comment.username}:<br />
                                    {comment.text}
                                    <div class='gameText'>
                                        <form action={`/games/${comment._id}/comment?_method=DELETE`} method='POST'>
                                            <input type='submit' value={`Delete Comment`} />
                                        </form>
                                        <a href={`/games/${gameId}/${comment._id}/editComment`}><input type='button'/>Edit</a>
                                    </div>
                                </li>
                            )
                        })
                    }
                </ul>
```

## Controller for Main Model **use both** 

```js 
const gameDataController = require('./gameDataController')
const gameViewController = require('./gameViewController')
const commentDataController = require('./commentDataController')
const commentViewController = require('./commentViewController')
```

## BIGGEST CHALLENGE 

My biggest challenege was the comment functionality. 

## KEY LEARNING AND KEY TAKEAWAY 

My biggest takeaway was gaining a deeper understanding of objects. I'm pretty sure I am tramzatized by the *Cannot GET* error. 	:face_exhaling:  

## Things I want to add 
- :pushpin: Login Authentication to allow a user to only edit, delete, and post comments under their username.  
- :pushpin: Authorization to only allow an admin to upload games. 
- :pushpin: Third party API to provide data regarding current ratings and prices. *Twich has a third party API, for free if you have a twicth memeber and set up two step authentication.*
- :pushpin: Play around with the CSS to make website more appealing 
- :pushpin: Develop a navigation bar with for different console that contains games for that specific console.
